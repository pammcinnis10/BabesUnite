					CO-MERMAID OF HONOR, MICHELLE IRETON (aka Baby Mi or Sausage Sister) - Baby Mi is my little sister, coming into this world 6 years after myself. We share an immense love for cute dogs, especially dogs being held above water and air swimming. This is our mutual weakness!! We will never pass up an opportunity to belt Disney anthems, though admittedly Baby Mi will crush me in pitch and tone, being the amazing NYC singer/ musical theatre performer that she is! I feel very lucky to have witnessed Baby Mi on stage. Everytime I hear her sing and watch her perform I feel extremely proud, overtaken with goose bumps by how she lights up on stage. ü§©
					We adore the same dystopian novels, running with Snickers in the lead, and shocking as it may be to our father, in adulthood, we have discovered a mutual culinary passion. Our combined energy could possibly break the <span><a class="gzk" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greisen‚ÄìZatsepin‚ÄìKuzmin_limit">GZK limit!</a></span>

					CO-MERMAID OF HONOR, PARISA MOHAMMAD (aka P Funk) - Parisa and I met as mere teenagers at ages 16 & 17, working at the classic Ohio breakfast spot, Bob Evan's. The 5 years to follow can be summarized as a time of ‚ÄòBeautiful Chaos.‚Äô During this time we discovered our appreciation for macabre humour connected us, seemingly for life. While we do share an enjoyment of yoga, healthy recipes, Berenstein Bear books, and proper fitting apparel, what most deeply unites us is our ability to literally share anything and everything..ensuing in PBLs and ABJs (proper belly laughs and actual belly jiggles). Parisa understands the importance of a perfectly timed meme whenever i'm in dire need of amusement to keep my sanity. Parisa hails from San Diego originally, and now resides in Los Angeles. Her vocation as a Nutritionist has assisted me in my many dietary woes over the years, whether posing a question as a Diabetic, vegetarian, pescatarian, or carnivore. P Funk and I go together like Coors Light & Cherry Bombs. But don't actually drink those..just trust me, they/ we are a perfect pair üëå

					ANDREA PANITZ (aka Hun) - Hun and I share mutual obsessions with curating top notch playlists and creating Olympic team events to compete in at cottages. This usually involves opening ceremonies with team jingles, most notably, Honey Lager Dogs; a song about dogs who bring you your beer through the fog. In the last 3 years our love for games has translated into The Spastic Towels, our beach volleyball team. In 2012, The Huns welcomed me in with friendship and open arms upon my move to Canada. We have since tasted, judged & Prost!‚Äôed many beers together. üçª
					Hun always brings a super dose of positive energy and is a total joy to be around, party with, and dance party with! Don't miss her on the dance floor come June 8th, she'll undoubtedly have the most requests üòâ

					SARAH NOORDEN (aka Hawkette) - It could be said that it's a competition for who is more competitive between Sarah and I. It's also a fairly close race for who requires a more frequent supply of snacks. Combined with our serious infatuation to play as many sports and games as possible, these similarities make it easy to relate to one another. Sarah and I play in beach volleyball leagues together twice a week, throughout the entire year. We match up well against each other in tennis, and have shared hikes, cross country ski trips, ping pong tournaments, and a foam fest obstacle course together.  I met Sarah when she started dating Adam (Hawk and co Best Man) in 2014. They are now engaged and also living in our neighborhood! Sarah is super easy to get along with, always up for adventures, and a hard worker. We can agree that after we've played all the sports, and refueled our bodies with food, a cheers with pints of wheat beer is in order! üçª

					PAM McINNIS (aka Pam Jam, Pam Funby, or St. Pammy) - Pam and I met on my first ever trip to Toronto. At the time Brock was living in a house with Pam's then boyfriend, now Husband, Shaggy (his real name is Matt, also co Best Man). In a lovely fate, our home is now less than a 10 minute walk from their home. Pam and I share an affinity for sour ales, coffee, tea (if we've had too much of the former), dogs, & books. Pam is a great listener and an extremely dependable friend. I know I can count on Pam for legitimately anything. She is always open for my crazy ideas, outfits, and events that I throw at her.  I recently discovered that Pam is a master photo bomber.. I already had massive respect for Pam, but this took her to the next level. I am so fortunate to have such a wonderful friend and neighbor as Pam Jam üòä

					JOHN KENTHOL (aka, Johnith) - My friendship with John likely dates back to grade 1, but neither of us can really remember.  From pool halls to pool parties, I have been close with John for a long time. Years would sometimes separate hang out sessions but you‚Äôd never know it as we would pick up wherever we left off.  John adds his name to this illustrious list by holding some of the best qualities one could ask for in a friend.  1) Kind to everyone 2)  the ability to get along with anyone 3) will bend over backwards for his friends. I like to say ‚ÄúIf you do not get along with John then there is something wrong with you‚Äù.

					JAY SHAW (aka, JBone) - I met Jay summer 2006 in a research lab at Brock University. We were both hired as research assistants and hit it off immediately.  Balancing work and fun while often blending the two was a passion we both shared.  That year I likely developed more as a human than any other time in my life and Jay was an integral part of that process. Friends like Jay are essential in any success story as they demonstrate through example how to be a good human being in so many facets of life..  From editing papers and preparing for job interviews to creating games out of thin air, Jay is a go to friend for advice in both work and play.

					IAN MORSON (aka Hun, aka Morson Man) - Ian and I have known each other since elementary school but have grown ever closer in recent years.  Since he and his wife, Andrea, refer to each other as ‚ÄúHun‚Äù, Laura and I have adopted this reference and also call them ‚ÄúHun‚Äù.  Maybe it is this way of addressing him that has led me to feeling so close to him in recent years.  We will never really know.  Ian, like John, is able to get along with absolutely anyone.  Just watch out for belligerent Ian which usually comes after beer 6.  Belligerent Ian will put you in your place while showing you the time of your life.

					MATT McINNIS (aka Shaggy) - When I first met Shaggy I had just walked into his house for the first time.  He asked me to pick an object in the room.  I chose the lamp.  He then proceeded to drop kick the lamp. A lot of valuable life advice is packed into that 6 second time frame.  Years later Shaggy and I would decide to become roommates at an Arcade Fire concert which was coincidentally the same year Laura and I met.  Shaggy is a wonderful friend whose opinions and advices I hold in the highest regard which makes him an obvious choice for co-best man.  His presence in Leslieville was key in our decision to purchase a home the area in 2017.

					ADAM PATERSON (aka Spastic Hawk) - Since grade 2 Adam has always been good conversation.  From sparkling erasers to weedstocks, we‚Äôve covered a lot of material over the years. Forever bonded by our chronic sleeping issues and love for productivity, Adam and I have demonstrated over the years that we are extremely proficient at having a good time.  Adam takes the title of co-best man for many reasons, including moving to California and providing the situation for Laura and I to meet in 2011.  It should also be noted that Adam is the best wing man that any guy could ever ask for.
